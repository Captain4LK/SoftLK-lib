# SLK_3d_fixed [WIP]

A polygon sowftware renderer. For an example see examples/3d, the wiki contains documentation for the types and functions availible.

## Kixor object loader

The included object loader is based on the [kixor object loader](https://www.kixor.net/dev/objloader/). According to the website the code is in the public domain. 

I modified the code (fixed some things, renamed functions and types to kixor_*), but my changes can be considered public domain.
