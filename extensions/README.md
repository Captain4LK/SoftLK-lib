# Extensions

I want to keep SoftLK-lib itself as small as possible. Thus, any advanced functionality will be developed as a separate, optional extension. Those extensions are build as a separate library file and can be linked as such.

Currently there is one extension for SoftLK-lib.

## License

All extensions are dual licensed under the terms of the 3-clause BSD license and the unlicense. I choose the unlicense as a second option, since this contains more complex functionality, which I think is worth releasing into the public domain as a learning resource.

See LICENSE for more details.

## Documentation

You can either look at the wiki or try to figure things out yourself by looking at the header files, which are located in the include directory of this repository. Additionally there is at least one example for each extension.

## SoftLK_gui

A basic Gui framework.
